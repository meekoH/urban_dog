                            <p>Urbandog policies ensure every guest receives the best care possible in a safe and healthy environment.</p>

                            <h2 style="font-weight:400;" id="playNice">Our Play Nice Policy<br><span style="text-transform:none;">You are among friends here</span></h2>

                            <p>Our staff are trained to keep a watchful eye, monitoring the dogs in our care, looking for inappropriate behavior and unbalanced play. Even our friends that visit frequently are closely monitored as often dogs will change as they age, mature, experiment and experience new things.</p>

                            <p>We will discourage excessive barking, excessive humping, unsolicited rough play, toy or food possession, guarding and bullying other dogs to name a few.</p>

                            <p>We work with offending dogs to redirect undesirable actions and behaviours and will always take caution to remove the offending dog from the group when necessary.</p>

                            <p>We will communicate any issues that may arise and work with you to improve unwanted behaviours.</p>

                            <hr>

                            <h2 style="font-weight:400;">Our General Policies</h2>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Age Eligibility</span><br>
                                <i class="fa fa-circle bullet-point"></i> Puppies : Two weeks after completing their second series of DHPP (Distemper/Hepatitis/Parvovirosis/Parainfluenza) vaccinations (usually given at 12 weeks of age). Puppies 16 weeks of age or older require a Rabies vaccination.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Spay / Neuter</span><br>
                                Dogs 7 months of age or older must be spayed or neutered prior to attendance.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Social Status</span><br>
                                All dogs must be comfortably social with other dogs and humans.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Health</span><br>
                                The health of our guests is paramount. Therefore, dogs must be free of any condition that could potentially jeopardize the health of other dogs . Any dog that has been ill with a communicable condition will require veterinarian certification of good health prior to a booking confirmation.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Safety Issues</span><br>
                                Urbandog promotes a very social, healthy and safe environment. Therefore, we reserve the right to refuse admittance to any dog that does not meet our health and behavior requirements. While in Playcare, dogs are expected to obtain a certain degree of "playcare etiquette" and Urbandog attendants will enforce certain rules (no excessive barking, no jumping, no fighting, etc.) with a kind but firm demeanor. Among other things, "time-out" may be used to modify bad behaviour and give dogs a chance to calm down. Other consequences such as expulsion may be necessary if bad behavior persists.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Reservations</span><br>
                                Playcare space is available on a first-come, first-served basis. Playcare reservations are required, so please call at least 48 hours in advance. This ensures we have the right number of attendants on hand to give your Dog the level of supervision and attention he/she deserves. If your plans change, just let us know 24 hours in advance to avoid our “one day” cancellation fee. 
                            </p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Safety</span><br>
                                For everyone’s safety, dogs must be brought in on a clip leash and wear a collar.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Vaccinations</span><br>
                                Dogs must be free of fleas and ticks and on a veterinarian approved flea prevention program from June through November. All dogs must be up to date with their vaccinations. These vaccinations include Distemper, Adenovirus Type 2, Parvovirus, Bordetella and Rabies for dogs. Guardians are required to provide veterinarian certification. Proof of titers are accepted in lieu of above vaccinations. Please allow a minimum of seventy-two (72) hours to pass between giving your dog these vaccinations and using our services. If at any time your dog is found to have fleas or ticks we will provide the appropriate flea or tick removal treatment at your expense.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Behaviour</span><br>
                                All dogs must be non-aggressive. Guardians will need to certify that their dog(s) have not harmed or shown any aggressive or threatening behavior towards any person or any other dog(s). Please remember that your dog will be spending time with other dogs and that their safety and health is our main concern.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Temperment Assessment</span><br>
                                All dogs must complete a temperament assessment prior to using our playcare services for the first time.</p>

                            <!-- <p><span class="bold orange">Feeding</span><br>
                                For our overnight guests we request you bring your dog or cat’s regular food to avoid causing possible digestive issues (diarrhea, upset stomach, etc.). We feed in the morning and evening. Please separate each meal in a zip-top bag clearly-marked with name and any special feeding instructions (i.e. add water, etc.). Take the same approach for canned, raw or packaged meals. Please add an extra food bag for your dog/cat during their stay just in case you are delayed in picking up your dog/cat. This will ensure your dog/cat will have enough food while they are here and give peace of mind knowing every meal is properly prepared and the serving amount correct.  Please do not bring in open pet food bags or plastic containers.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Medication</span><br>
                                We are happy to give medication, but require the Medication Form to be completed each time your dog/cat stays with us. All medication must be in its original container. Please note that while Park9 will administer the medications as required, we do not represent that our staff has been specifically trained to treat your dog/cat’s medical condition. We do not accept dogs or cats that require medical treatment beyond the dispensing of medication (i.e. drains, bandage changes, suture removal, etc...).</p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Specials Needs &amp; Medical Care</span><br>
                                Park9 recognizes that some of our guests may have special needs. Clients must identify any special requirements with us when making a reservation, including but not limited to: medications, supplements, special meal preparation, extra feeding times, daily brushing, puppy care, and senior care (Additional charges may apply).</p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Personal Items</span><br>
                                Please do not bring personal items or toys with your dog/cat that are valuable or irreplaceable. Park9 is not responsible for loss or damage to any personal item or toy.</p>

                            <p>For dog boarding stays longer than three days, we highly recommend a BATH prior to pick up. You and your dog will be much happier at pickup after a bath!</p> -->
