                            <p>If you are a first time client to Park9 or Urbandog you must first register using the attached enrollment forms before any booking can be confirmed. It’s quite simple (but very thorough!)</p>

                            <p>NOTE: You may choose to check availability before you register by <a href="contact.php" title="Contact">calling us</a> directly or sending in your <a href="reservations.php" title="Reservations">request</a>.</p>

                            <p class="bold orange">Current Urbandog clients are not required to register for Park9 or have their dog reassessed.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Step One -</span> Complete our profile form for your cat or dog, including signing our Release and Care Agreement. Download and email your completed documentation to us at <a href="mailto:info@urbandog.ca" title="Email UrbanDog">info@urbandog.ca</a></p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Step Two -</span> Contact your veterinarian to have them email or fax copies of all your best friend’s vaccination certificates directly to us. Please make sure you meet our Dog and Cat enrollment requirements listed below.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold orange">Step Three -</span> One of our staff will be in touch within 24 hours to arrange for your <a href="blog_detailed.php?blogid=16" title="Assessment Blog">assessment</a> and answer any questions you may have about our facility, our process and how to book your first visit.</p>

                            <h2>Our Assessment Procees</h2>

                            <p>In order to ensure the happiness and well-being of all dogs in our care, dogs are required to undergo an initial assessment prior to coming to stay with us. This assessment gives us an opportunity to ensure that your dog is a good fit for Park9 and just as important, that we are a good fit for your dog!</p>

                            <h2 style="font-weight:400;">Getting to know you...</h2>

                            <p>During the assessment, our daycare manager or designate team member will review your completed enrollment forms and dog profile with you. We want to know as much about your dog as possible, so don't be shy with the details. After all, nobody is perfect, even our wonderful canine companions!</p>

                            <h2 style="font-weight:400;">Meet &amp; Greet...</h2>

                            <p>We will take the time to personally get acquainted with your dog, away from other dogs, one on one. We want you best friends to rest assured that they can trust us. We won't force any dog into anything that they are not yet comfortable with; an essential element to a smooth transition from new environment to awesome hangout!</p>

                            <h2 style="font-weight:400;">Let's Make Friends...</h2>

                            <p>Next, our team member will lead your dog to our playground, let them sniff around and "read" all about what our other dogs have to say!</p>

                            <p>Once your dog seems more at ease, we will begin to introduce some friends!  We'll start with playmates with similar traits or personalities and then move on to dogs with very different characteristics and play-styles. We want to ensure that your dog is comfortable and tolerant of ALL of our special guests.</p>

                            <p>We will monitor your dog’s body language, behavior and reactions during these first introductions. The degree of interaction with the others will be a decision made by your dog.</p>

                            <h2 style="font-weight:400;">Even Shy Dogs Can Shine...</h2>

                            <p>In some cases, it may take a few days/visits for your dog to completely come out of their shell. It is not uncommon for our new friends to stay on the sidelines, watching the others interact and take it all in before becoming engaged themselves. It is always rewarding to watch our "wallflowers" blossom!</p> -->
