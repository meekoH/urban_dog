The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology index is currently trading at a trailing P/E of just over 18x. This is just under the current P/E of 18.5x for the S&amp;P 500 and well below its 1999 high of 30x. Likewise, the NASDAQ composite is trading at 21x against a high of 29x in 1999. These multiples are above average on a historical basis but are close to the midpoint of the average over the last 20 years when low inflation and low interest rates (which look set to continue) have generally pushed up equity valuations.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">What does look over valued is the Cloud space. The Bessemer Index stocks look expensive relative to the enterprise sector. To arrive at this conclusion we analyzed two portfolios that we created out of the current market:</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ol>\n	<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n		<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span>Bessemer Cloud Index: 35 stocks with an average revenue growth of 26% and 8% free cash flow (FCF) to revenue, priced at 6.5x revenue</span></li>\n	<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n		<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Top five enterprise stocks: Average growth of 3% and FCF to revenue of 27%, priced at 4.0x revenue.<span style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n	<span style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">There is no easy way to directly compare these two portfolios today so we decided to run a range of five year forecast scenarios to see which would perform better under a variety of assumptions. Underlying most of our scenarios was the assumption that over the next five years the Bessemer Index&#39;s performance should start to converge toward that of mature stocks with lower growth and higher profits. Given that mature stocks are already the survivors of a similar process it seems unlikely that the full Bessemer Index will be able to match the top five in terms of performance at maturity and we used that as a top end scenario.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Under the majority of the scenarios we found that an EV to Sales premium of 25% to 30% for the Bessemer Index looked reasonable (equating to an EV to Sales ratio of roughly 5x) but anything further looked rich. They looked even more expensive in any scenario where interest rates increased thereby increasing the cost of deferring cash for growth.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Given that the current premium is 50% it looks like there is room for further downward pressure. Of course, cloud stocks have generally traded at premiums larger than 25% for quite a while so it is very possible that the current spread will persist for some time.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>In conclusion</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">All of the recent talk of technology bubbles and any comparison to 1999 are pretty absurd looking. The public technology market is certainly not cheap but on a P/E basis they are about 30% lower than 1999 and don&rsquo;t look out of line relative to the broader markets. That said, there is reasonably good evidence that public cloud stocks are still overvalued relative to the broader technology market. It is hard to account for the exuberance of the markets for high growth tech companies but if we were investing we would favor the mature companies or those higher EBITDA Bessemer Index companies that seem to be trading cheaper than their peers.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">All of this is not to say that we don&rsquo;t believe in the cloud or SaaS. We do! That is largely what we invest in. As a general category, the cloud/SaaS companies are building up very high quality revenue and we believe that there remains lots of room for further growth given the relatively low penetration of SaaS technology. We don&rsquo;t love the current multiples for public cloud businesses but private market multiples are considerably lower and more attractive even when we account for the increased risk involved in investing in small, illiquid companies.</span></p>\n',1,'2014-07-08 10:14:41',1,'2014-07-09 16:07:36',1),
	(15,'blog/630879184_83998082_sales-graph-up[1].png','FIVE STEPS TO INCREASED SALES','February 11, 2014','<p>\n	<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>By Will Anderson</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Want more sales? You need to add more reps, right?</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Well, maybe - but probably not.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Most mature software companies feel like they have the internal capacity to deliver and support more clients, but struggle to add the sales capacity to bring in incremental business economically. They add reps but typically less than 50% of new hires last more than a sales cycle or two. After going through this process for a while, rational managers often conclude that there is not more growth to be had and they settle down to become a good but slow growing company. Sometimes the market is really not going to produce more growth, but usually not.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Technology is a great industry. The pace of investment in any given technology market typically greatly exceeds the growth of the underlying market. Furthermore, most markets remain fragmented with weaker players winning deals that the best companies do not have the sales capacity to reach. Some markets and some companies are definitely growth constrained but that is the exception rather than the rule. You do not have to be a leading player to get more sales. As long as there are players with a worse offering doing any sort of deals then there is room for growth.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">How do you do it? Well first, don&rsquo;t start by adding more reps. Add sales capacity. Sales is more than reps. It is a system. Sales systems differ from company to company but almost all are made up of lead generation, sales engineers and sales reps. The reason so many companies struggle to increase capacity is that they invest only the reps. The orthodoxy in software is great reps are what let great companies win &ndash; and thus, having more of them is always good. But when these companies fail to build up the support capacity that feeds these new reps, even the good ones fail.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The key then, is to invest in the system as a whole. To keep things in balance and provide the reps, which are undoubtedly important, with the support they need. Based on this philosophy, Klass Software has adopted a five step process to drive sales in our acquired businesses without making massive upfront investments. This is a very incremental approach that aims first to figure out if there really is a market to grow into and then to improve growth inch by inch while keeping investment reasonable and ensuring that the system remains in balance.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 28.35pt; text-align: justify;\">\n	<strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em>Step 1:&nbsp; Segment Leads</em></span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 28.35pt; text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Step one is to figure out which leads are the quality ones that we want to focus rep attention on and which are the weak ones that we want to cut or crowd out. To do this we classify our leads across various dimensions like lead source, current system, customer type or customer size, and calculate out which ones we usually win and which are typically lost causes.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 28.35pt; text-align: justify;\">\n	<strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em>Step 2:&nbsp; Generate More Quality Leads</em></span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 28.35pt; text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Once we know which leads are the quality ones we want to take our existing lead generation spend and shift it around to increase the number of quality leads and decrease the weak one. If we have sales capacity when increasing quality leads, we will crowd out work on weak leads and our revenue per rep will increase. If we see our revenue per rep start to slow down while our cost per lead remains reasonable then we know that we are running out of capacity and we can move to step three. Conversely, if we start to see the cost per lead increasing then it is usually a sign that something is wrong. It may be the market, or it may be our marketing strategy but either way it is a sign for us to pause the experiment until we can get revenue per rep to slow and cost per lead to stay low.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 28.35pt; text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">There are also a number of technology solutions that can be used to increase the number and quality of leads that your marketing efforts generate. Proper use of CRM and a Marketing Automation software can provide an efficient way for your company to get their brand out in the market and generate demand.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 28.35pt; text-align: justify;\">\n	<strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em>Step 3:&nbsp; Add Sales Engineers</em></span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 28.35pt; text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Once the revenue per rep has slowed down it is time to add more capacity. Still, we do not yet add reps; we first add sales engineers. Sales reps typically come up to speed much quicker than sales engineers so if we don&rsquo;t bring in the engineers first we will end up starving our reps of demo time and wasting their time. The lead time on sales engineers for all but the most simple software applications is measured in months or years so we often look to get a jump on this process. When we start to see traction in increasing quality leads in step two, we look to build up excess capacity on sales engineers that we can grow into. Sales engineers are usually subject matter experts and no software company has too many of those. If we end up not needing the extra capacity, it can always be used elsewhere.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 28.35pt; text-align: justify;\">\n	<strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em>Step 4:&nbsp; Add Sales Coordinators or Junior Reps</em></span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 28.35pt; text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The fastest route to adding capacity is adding people but the economical way is to optimize. Sales engineers and sales reps are expensive and take a long time to train. We want to use them as effectively as possible and that means keeping them in front of clients. While adding sales engineers early is prudent, it is often possible to squeeze more capacity out of both reps and engineers by hiring cheaper junior sales coordinators or reps to manage calendars and databases, qualify leads and keep the reps and sales engineers on the front lines. Unlike sales engineers, reps have little use if there is nothing to work on and they can come up fast so we try to get as much as we can from the ones we have before we push to get more.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 28.35pt; text-align: justify;\">\n	<strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em>Step 5:&nbsp; Now Add Reps</em></span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 28.35pt; text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Reps are the end of the chain. To be successful they need leads and they need people to do demos. When we have capacity in these areas we have a good platform on which to develop good reps. We still have to hire and train well but it is all much easier when we have the support systems there and ready to help the new people &ndash; especially in the early days. Sales reps with spare time are very wasteful because they tend to use other resource to chase down low probability stuff. With good support structures, their ramp up time is relatively short so this is the area where we generally constrain our capacity and add only as absolutely needed.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">We have structured our approach into five distinctive steps but in reality we run them continuously and in parallel. The key to the process is watching capacity at all levels and ensuring that it stays in balance. Any sort of massive investment like the typical mad dash to add sales reps will typically just throw the system off and be quite wasteful. Our more incremental approach seeks to see benefit from smaller investments up front and use new revenue to build confidence and fund further investment in a virtuous cycle. If done successfully, sales growth becomes relatively simple after a few cycles &ndash; then the hard work starts as the constraint moves away from sales capacity into either the market or the operations.&nbsp;</span></p>\n',1,'2014-07-09 16:03:37',1,'2014-07-09 16:12:34',1),
	(16,'blog/885929942_78591883_linkedin[1].jpg','A SIMPLE LINKEDIN TIP TO HELP TURN OLD CUSTOMERS INTO NEW CUSTOMERS','July 10, 2014','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>By Will Anderson</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Who is your best possible lead? A reasonable guess would be a former evangelist that has moved onto a new company who does not yet use your product. Have you ever been proactive and about finding these former clients who are now excellent leads in their new roles? I will admit that thought had never crossed my mind until this week when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jamietshanks\">Jamie Shank</a> from <a href=\"http://www.salesforlife.com/\">Sales4Life</a> showed how to do it using LinkedIn at the Toronto Sales Hacker event.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<u><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Here&rsquo;s how to do it:</span></u></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1. Click the advanced link next to the standard LinkedIn Search</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><img src=\"http://klass.com/uploads/ckeditor_images/1404940363_1.png\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; width: 624px; height: 40px;\" /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. In the Company box enter a list of your customers with OR separating each. In my made up example we will consider a company selling HR solutions to law firms. Once you do that, a separate box will appear with options for past or current employees. As we are looking for people who have left our clients, we will select &ldquo;Past not current.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><img src=\"http://klass.com/uploads/ckeditor_images/1404940384_2.png\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; width: 236px; height: 114px;\" /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">3. Use the relationship selection to make your list as broad or narrow as you like (if these are good references they are hopefully 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> connections.) Once selected hit search.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><img src=\"http://klass.com/uploads/ckeditor_images/1404940396_3.png\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; width: 213px; height: 153px;\" /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">4. At this point in my search I have an unwieldy 4,345 contacts. To get a better targeted list I will use further search criteria like seniority and role to narrow in on my ideal prospect. If you are not a premium LinkedIn user you will not have all of these but you can approximate the results using the general title search field.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><img src=\"http://klass.com/uploads/ckeditor_images/1404940404_4.png\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; width: 221px; height: 347px;\" /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">5. Now we have a much more targeted list of 32 VPs and Directors within administrative positions who were once with our client and are now (hopefully) ready to buy again.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">6. To keep on top of your former clients, save the search and set it to run regularly to give you a constant flow of high potential leads.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><img src=\"http://klass.com/uploads/ckeditor_images/1404940413_5.png\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; width: 624px; height: 114px;\" /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span id=\"cke_bm_93E\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">This is just one of several LinkedIn tricks that Jamie presented last night.

But, as any baseball fan knows, the chance of their team making the World Series is slim without the right mix of players, training and support. In the same way, family business owners need to identify and hone in on those key elements in their business strategy to win the close games.</p>\n<p>\n	In baseball, a team doesn&rsquo;t become a World Series contender by chance. Similarly, growth in business &ndash; especially in the current economy &ndash; is challenging. Establishing a loyal customer base, combined with a commitment to continuous innovation, can help family businesses distinguish themselves from their competitors and stand out across industries.</p>\n<p>\n	For most businesses, there typically comes a time when a decision needs to be made about whether to maintain current growth levels or to expand. While growth isn&rsquo;t always the safest or simplest option, it is essential to achieve market penetration and long term competitiveness. In baseball, we&rsquo;ve seen teams disappear because they didn&rsquo;t grow. But in baseball and in business, by evaluating &ndash; and re-evaluating &ndash; the business plan before taking the leap to grow, the risks associated with getting to the next level can be drastically reduced.</p>\n','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00',0),

As investors in private technology companies the short-term fluctuations in stock markets are not something we usually pay all that much attention to. However, the sheer volume of ink spilled over it in the past couple of weeks had us wanting to do a bit of digging into the recent tech retreat to see what we could learn. From our review and research we came up with the following insights:</span></p>\n<ol>\n	<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n		<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The recent sell off has been largely confined to fast growing cloud stocks &ndash; mature technology businesses and the markets in general have been largely flat.</span></li>\n	<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n		<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The market bases its value of cloud companies on revenue growth and seems to ignore profitability &ndash; the recent fall does not appear to have changed this.</span></li>\n	<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n		<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The broad technology market looks fairly valued but cloud stocks still look overvalued by 25% or more.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n	<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Technology in general has been fine &ndash; it is the cloud stocks that got hammered.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">With all the negative attention that the technology space has been getting you would think that the NASDAQ composite would have taken a beating over the past couple of months. It hasn&rsquo;t. It is down less than 1%. Likewise, the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Sector has been basically flat. The story is in cloud technology. The 35 public cloud technology companies that make up Bessemer Venture Partners&rsquo; Cloud Index were down by an average of 29% from February 28th to April 28th. Cloud leaders like Salesforce and Workday were down 21% and 38% respectively while the old guard like Microsoft (up 7%) and Oracle (up 4%) seemed to benefit from a rebalancing from new to old.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">This followed a period where the Cloud stocks jumped way ahead of the broader NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500. From this it appears to us that this recent fall was a rebalancing within the technology market rather than the beginning of a sector wide shift.</span></p>\n<p class=\"center\">\n	<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://klass.com/uploads/ckeditor_images/1404749311_BVP_Cloud.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 579px;\" /></p>\n<p>\n	<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Growth is king for cloud companies and EBITDA is largely ignored</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The best possible explanatory value for the recent fall in the value of the companies within the Bessemer Index was revenue growth. As shown below, the higher the 2014 revenue growth the larger the market adjustment over the past couple of months. It seems that the market got ahead of itself on valuing companies by growth and spent the last two months dialing that back.</span></p>\n<p class=\"center\">\n	<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://klass.com/uploads/ckeditor_images/1404749380_2-month-price-change.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 531px;\" /></p>\n<p>\n	<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><small>In above chart (and in those to follow) the blue points represent the companies that make up the Bessemer Index and the red points represent five of the top enterprise software stocks by market cap (IBM, Oracle, Microsoft, SAP, and Intuit).</small></span></p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Digging further, we found that revenue growth was not only the primary explanatory variable for performance but also for relative value. More interestingly, EBITDA has almost no meaningful explanatory value. In running a series of regressions we found that 2014 expected revenue growth explains roughly 45% of the differing EV to Sales ratios of the Bessemer Index companies. EBITDA margin, which is the primary driver for EV to Sales ratios for more mature companies, was largely uncorrelated with value for high growth cloud company valuations.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Even with the recent revaluation this relationship does not seem to have changed. The market has dramatically narrowed EV to Sales ratios across the Bessemer Index companies but growth remains the primary value driver with EBITDA contributing very little. Both before and after the fall the market incentive has been for companies to invest profits now for further growth and are happy to defer profitability down the line.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><small><strong>Enterprise Value / Revenue and Revenue Growth Comparison Feb 28 - Apr 28, 2014</strong></small></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><small><i>Sales growth is a major driver of EV / Revenue ratios for SaaS companies.

Even as EV / Revenue ranges narrowed from Feb 28 (top chart) to Apr 28 (bottom chart) there was no fundamental change and investors have not started to focus more on EBITDA. This seems like an opportunity.</i></small></span></p>\n<p class=\"center\">\n	<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://klass.com/uploads/ckeditor_images/1404751154_ebitdapercent-feb.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 532px;\" /></p>\n<p class=\"center\">\n	<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://klass.com/uploads/ckeditor_images/1404751184_ebitdapercent-april.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 532px;\" /></p>\n<hr />\n<p>\n	<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>The technology markets look fairly valued but cloud stocks still look expensive relative to their mature peers</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Absent any massive macroeconomic shocks the broad technology market looks fairly valued to us. The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology index is currently trading at a trailing P/E of just over 18x. This is just under the current P/E of 18.5x for the S&amp;P 500 and well below its 1999 high of 30x. Likewise, the NASDAQ composite is trading at 21x against a high of 29x in 1999. These multiples are above average on a historical basis but are close to the midpoint of the average over the last 20 years when low inflation and low interest rates (which look set to continue) have generally pushed up equity valuations.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">What does look over valued is the Cloud space. The Bessemer Index stocks look expensive relative to the enterprise sector. To arrive at this conclusion we analyzed two portfolios that we created out of the current market:</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ol>\n	<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n		<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span>Bessemer Cloud Index: 35 stocks with an average revenue growth of 26% and 8% free cash flow (FCF) to revenue, priced at 6.5x revenue</span></li>\n	<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n		<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Top five enterprise stocks: Average growth of 3% and FCF to revenue of 27%, priced at 4.0x revenue.<span style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n	<span style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">There is no easy way to directly compare these two portfolios today so we decided to run a range of five year forecast scenarios to see which would perform better under a variety of assumptions. Underlying most of our scenarios was the assumption that over the next five years the Bessemer Index&#39;s performance should start to converge toward that of mature stocks with lower growth and higher profits. Given that mature stocks are already the survivors of a similar process it seems unlikely that the full Bessemer Index will be able to match the top five in terms of performance at maturity and we used that as a top end scenario.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Under the majority of the scenarios we found that an EV to Sales premium of 25% to 30% for the Bessemer Index looked reasonable (equating to an EV to Sales ratio of roughly 5x) but anything further looked rich. They looked even more expensive in any scenario where interest rates increased thereby increasing the cost of deferring cash for growth.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Given that the current premium is 50% it looks like there is room for further downward pressure. Of course, cloud stocks have generally traded at premiums larger than 25% for quite a while so it is very possible that the current spread will persist for some time.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>In conclusion</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">All of the recent talk of technology bubbles and any comparison to 1999 are pretty absurd looking. The public technology market is certainly not cheap but on a P/E basis they are about 30% lower than 1999 and don&rsquo;t look out of line relative to the broader markets. That said, there is reasonably good evidence that public cloud stocks are still overvalued relative to the broader technology market. It is hard to account for the exuberance of the markets for high growth tech companies but if we were investing we would favor the mature companies or those higher EBITDA Bessemer Index companies that seem to be trading cheaper than their peers.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n	<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">All of this is not to say that we don&rsquo;t believe in the cloud or SaaS. We do! That is largely what we invest in. As a general category, the cloud/SaaS companies are building up very high quality revenue and we believe that there remains lots of room for further growth given the relatively low penetration of SaaS technology. We don&rsquo;t love the current multiples for public cloud businesses but private market multiples are considerably lower and more attractive even when we account for the increased risk involved in investing in small, illiquid companies.</span></p>\n','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'2014-07-08 07:55:54',1),
