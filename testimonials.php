                            <p>This place is amazing! My pooch loves it here and starts waging her tail in excitement as soon as we turn onto the street. She plays all day (which I can view on the webcam) and when she comes home, she is pooped for a full 24 hours! The staff really make this place - they all genuinely love dogs and treat my pooch like one of their own. Highly recommend these guys and know my pooch is in the best care.</p>

                            <p>Can't say enough about how good Urban Dog is! Kai loves it there and he is so well treated. The staff is friendly and well informed and really care for the dogs in their care. Wouldn't trust anywhere else with taking care of Kai! I love watching my dog on the webcam, you can tell he's having a great time. You can tell by the way the staff interacts with the dogs that they don't just work there, they are committed to making sure our dogs are healthy and happy while they are there.</p>

                            <p>An absolute brilliant place to bring your pooch! We are new play-care members and my dog just loves it! He gets such a workout by the time I get him home he is out cold in seconds.</p>

                            <p>Jack &amp; Miss Daisy wouldn't go anywhere else for grooming. Urbandog does such a great job with them!</p>

                            <p>My dog and I went into the store on snowy, cold afternoon, around 4:15 ish. Not only were the staff polite but they were very helpful. I went in for new boots for my dog as his kept falling off. Wanting the balloon boots instead of the Muttlucks I had, the gentleman went and got them for me, in most places they direct you to where they are. He didn't do that, he got them for me, in the size I needed and brought them to me. Having a reactive dog, I was having challanges getting boots on him when he was over stimulated from being at the Distillery in the crowd. That didn't deter the staff. The fellow offered but I said no thanks as my dog may bite. The woman came out and said she wasn't worried about that and she got all four boots on while the other lady fed him liver treats. I must say I am ever so impressed with the lvl of service I received, from what I understood the second lady was off duty and waiting for a cab but helped with the treats anyway. The woman who was working got my dog booted up no problem.</p>

                            <p>After all that fuss I realized I had asked my friend to hold my purse and had left it with her, they were very understanding while I ran out to get my wallet. All three staff impressed me highly, they were friendly, polite, helpful and assisted me greatly. I would return in a heartbeat.</p>

                            <p>I love Urban Dog. The space is large and the staff is always very pleasant and knowledgeable. I bring both my dogs there almost every day and they love it. A tired dog is a wonderful dog!</p>

                            <p>They are very connected with other dog/ animal services. My dog had a small issue one day and they called a nearby Vet for me to bring my dog to be seen. I feel my dogs are safe and well taken care of at Urban Dog. I absolutely recommend them.</p>

                            <p>This place is an amazing gift. I found it when I was undergoing cancer therapy and could not deal with my energetic Airedale. Since then, it is my treat to myself whenever I'm not up to the two daily walks it takes to settle home down (or when it's raining!). The space is great but the best and most important  asset Urban Dog Fitness has is the staff. They are friendly, professional, diligent and genuinely like dogs. They offer toys and food and doggie accessories in the front of the shop and have two large spaces for the dogs to play with in the back of the building. They also have an outdoor area. My dog gets excited as soon as he recognizes the route to this place and then, when I pick him up, he's happily exhausted. Great place!</p>

                            <p>I took my adolescent Cane Corso Lab mix to another daycare but was told, after his first and only day, that he couldn't be accommodated. I was in a bind and Urban Dog assessed him on short notice. They let me return the next day so my dog could get used to the space before his first day. Given his breed, age and energy levels, my boy requires a lot of supervision; they were up to the task and were very supportive of my dog. A welcoming place and definitely a cut above.</p>

                            <h2 style="font-weight:400;">Rufus Mortimer</h2>

                            <p>Rufus has been going to Urban Dog since he was a puppy and they are simply the best in the city. The care, the service - the knowledge. There are very few places I would trust my puppy to and Urban Dog is a safe secure environment for your puppy when you can't be home with him or her. Rufus is now 3 years old and no longer needs daycare but he does need a great groomer. I've taken him to several places but there is no better groomer in Toronto. Hands down they are amazing! Keep up the great work.</p>
