                            <p>Our facility was built to meet the many differing needs of cats and dogs.</p>

                            <p>Our accommodations offer a variety of choices to make your cat or dogâ€™s stay with us as comfortable as possible.</p>

                            <p>We offer day lounges for those dogs that need a bit of down time during the day away from the play.</p>

                            <p>We have a separate senior dog wing that offers heated floors and accommodations in a quieter location in the building close to the watchful eye of reception staff.</p>

                            <p>Ask us to help you select the best fit for your dog or cat.</p>

                            <p>We have implemented a number of "green" initiatives into our building to help keep everyone healthy, including the environment.</p>

                            <p>Hospital grade UV air filtration system throughout including a separate air exchange for our cat wing.</p>

                                <i class="fa fa-circle bullet-point"></i> A tubular daylighting system- this system is electricity-free, operating instead by focusing natural sunlight through reflective tubing into the playgrounds and pool and dispersing the light using a diffuser.</p>

                                <i class="fa fa-circle bullet-point"></i> UV technology filters the pool so no harmful chemicals or salt is used that can dry out sensitive skin and coats.<br><br>
                                <i class="fa fa-circle bullet-point"></i> Woven K9 Grass around the pool is specifically made for dogs and features a flushing system under the raised grass that removes all waste and water from around the pool.</p>
